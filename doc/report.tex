\section{General description of the project}

In essence, our project is an ``automatic laser aimer''.
We built a structure with two stepper motors and an attached laser
that will receive images from a camera.
This image is processed by the Raspberry Pi,
which then orders the stepper motors to rotate in order to
make the attached laser point towards a special marker in real world.

The marker is shown in figure \ref{fig:marker}.
The exact dimensions of the marker are known;
therefore, given a picture with the marker,
we can compute the distance between the camera and the marker.
The library ArUco does these calculations;
it gives us back a point in $3D$ space,
with the camera being the origin (point $(0, 0, 0)$).

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics[scale=0.1]{imgs/marker.jpg}
    \caption{The Augmented reality marker used}
    \label{fig:marker}
\end{figure}

But the laser is not centered in the camera,
so we need to calibrate the program to know where the camera is
and what are its rotation axis.
Four measurements are enugh:
first, move the marker to the front of the laser and take two photos
(with varying distances from the laser in each photo).
These two photos gives two points in the space
in the line of sight of the laser;
thus, the center of the laser and these two points are collinear.

Now, rotate the laser horizontally by a fixed number of degrees
(we have chosen $10$)
and take two more photos.
These photos give another pair of points collinear with the center of the laser.
This information is enough to determine everything needed
(the center of the laser and the rotation axis);
the maths are in section~\ref{sec:math}.

With the laser calibrated,
we can now make it aim to the marker!
After each photo taken,
the program calculates how much each stepper motor must rotate
in order to make the laser point to the marker.
After some cycles,
the laser is aimed there.

\section{Software Engineering}

We used an object-oriented approach to program the software;
this section has a brief description of each class
and the helper libraries we used in the project.

All the code is available in \verb"https://github.com/royertiago/INE5450".

Classes of the program:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \class{Aimer} class: once the measures of the axis are made,
there is a method in this function that creates a new thread that verify
every time the camera detects a marker and updates the laser position.
    \item \class{Ballistics} class: this class does the ``ballistic'' calculations
in order to rotate the stepper motors. It only receives measurements
and returns the rotation angles.
This class' procedures are described in section~\ref{sec:math}.
    \item \class{LaserAimer} class: like the \class{Aimer} class, this class
creates a new thread in charge of controlling the motors each time the 
\class{Aimer} thread updates the position of the marker.
    \item \class{LaserCalibrator} class: this one is responsible for catching
the 4 measures of the markers from the user that is using the program and make
that measure public for other classes, like \class{Ballistics} that use this
information to compute the axis.
    \item \class{TargetDetector} class: this class has the function of
detecting the augmented reality marker and giving back this information.
It detects the marker using the Aruco library.
This is used in \class{Aimer}, \class{LaserCalibrator} for example.
    \item \class{Stepper} class: each instance of this class is in charge of
controlling the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for each motor and it
gives a frendlier interface to someone that want to use the motors,
with methods such as \method{step(int n)} that execute \texttt{n} steps,
forwards or backwards depending on the signal of \texttt{n}
\end{itemize}

Libraries used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Aruco: Augmented reality library, it returns if detected the marker
and its 3D position.
    \item OpenCV: It's a open library for computer graphics otimizing as it can,
in multicore or in GPU. 
    \item WiringPi: This is a small library to control the GPIO pins in the
raspberry pi.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mathematics involved}
\label{sec:math}

This section describes the mathematics behind the \class{Ballistics} class.

The \class{Ballistics} class has only two methods: the constructor,
that computes the rotation axis based on four measurements and an angle;
and the \method{Ballistics::align} method,
which is given a new measurement and tells how many radians
each stepper motor must rotate in order to align the laser with the measurement.

\subsection{The constructor}
\label{sec:ballistics-constructor}

\emph{Input:}
The \class{Ballistics} constructor will receive four measurements
$p_1$, $p_2$, $q_1$ and $q_2$ and an angle $\alpha$.
(Here, an \emph{measurement} is just a $3D$ point in the euclidian space.)
Each measurement correspond to a point
that we know was in the line of sight of the laser.

\noindent \emph{Output:}
The four attributes of the current \class{Ballistics} object.

The first two measurements must be taken without moving the laser;
therefore, the center of rotation is on the line spanned by $p_1$ and $p_2$.
Then, the laser's line of sight must be rotated around the main rotation axis
by a specified angle $\alpha$ (which must also be supplied to the constructor).
The other two measurements must be taken now, again without moving the laser
(that is, the laser only rotates once, around its main rotation axis, by $\alpha$).
The line spanned by $q_1$ and $q_2$ therefore also contain the center.
Using the computations of the section~\ref{sec:line-line-intersection},
we can thus find the center of the laser.

Note the center of the laser will not be on the origin;
likewise, the rotation axis will very likely not be aligned to
the $x$, $y$ or $z$ axis.

The four attributes of the \class{Ballistics} class are
\begin{itemize}
    \item $u = \attribute{\_up}$,
        the vector that points ``up'' along the main rotation axis
    \item $l = \attribute{\_left}$,
        a vector that points ``left'' along the secondary rotation axis
    \item $f = \attribute{\_front}$,
        the vector that points to the ``front'' of the laser
    \item $c = \attribute{\_center}$,
        a point in the space which represents the center of the laser
\end{itemize}
Vectors $u$, $l$ and $f$ will be normalized.
Vectors $u$ and $l$ are always orthogonal;
vectors $l$ and $f$ are always orthogonal;
vectors $u$ and $f$ are almost always not orthogonal.

\attribute{\_center} was already computed.
\attribute{\_front} is easy: as it is the vector pointing along
the laser's line of sight,
it is just the normalized version of $q_1 - \attribute{\_center}$.
($q_2 - \attribute{\_center}$ would work just as well.)
Finding \attribute{\_up} is harder.

Call $A = p_1 - \attribute{\_center}$, $B = q_1 - \attribute{\_center}$.
Normalize both to get $||A|| = ||B|| = 1$.
Vector $B$ is exactly vector $A$ rotated around \attribute{\_up}
by $\alpha$ radians;
we will use this fact to compute \attribute{\_up}.

Note that the angle between $A$ and the plane orthogonal de \attribute{\_up}
is the same as the angle between $B$ and this plane.
This fact, together with the angles between $A$ and $B$
and the angle of rotation $\alpha$,
we can use the formula at the end of section~\ref{sec:angle-of-projection}
to compute the angle $\beta$ between $A$ and the plane.
(In the formula, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ have their roles reversed,
according to figure~\ref{fig:angle-of-projection};
$\gamma$ is the angle between $A$ and $B$.)

Call $M = (A + B)/2$; the observation that $M$,
$A \times B$ and \attribute{\_up} are all orthogonal
will allow us to finally compute \attribute{\_up}:
use the formula at the end of section~\ref{sec:finding-the-axis}
to compute the angle between $M$ and \attribute{\_up},
then rotate $M$ through that plane by the computed angle $\delta$.
Now normalize;
this gives us \attribute{\_up}.

And, finally, given \attribute{\_up} and \attribute{\_front},
\attribute{\_left} is just the cross product between these two.

\subsection{Aiming the laser}

After each photo taken,
we must compute the rotation angles to realign the laser
and update the values of \attribute{\_front} and \attribute{\_left}.

Suppose we are given a new umasurement $p$.
The first thing to do is to replase $p$ by $p - \attribute{\_center}$,
moving the center of the laser to origin of the world.
We will now compute the rotation angle for the main axis
(the axis through the \attribute{\_up} vector).

The rotation occours in a plane orthogonal to \attribute{\_up},
so the angle calculation must be done there.
Project both \attribute{\_front} and $p$ to this plane,
and compute the angle between them;
this is the rotation angle for the main axis.

(Actually is a little more complicated:
the angle given by the formula
\begin{equation*}
    \langle a, b \rangle = ||A|| ||B|| \cos \theta
\end{equation*}
is ``unsigned''; that is,
it does not tell us to which side we must rotate.
To actually get the side,
we rotate the projection of \attribute{\_front} to both sides
and see which came closer to the projection of $p$.)

Now, we will compute the rotation on the secondary axis
(the axis through the \attribute{\_left} vector).
First rotate both \attribute{\_front} and \attribute{\_left}
through \attribute{\_up} by this angle;
\attribute{\_left} is left in its final position.

Now, \attribute{\_front} and $p$
are in the same plane orthogonal to \attribute{\_left};
we proceed in the same manner
--- compute the angle between \attribute{\_front} and $p$
and discover to which side is the rotation.

Finally, set \attribute{\_front} to $p / ||p||$
(because $p$ is to which the laser points now)
and return the computed angles.

\subsection{Line-line intersection}
\label{sec:line-line-intersection}

(The remainder of this section has only the calculations
that support the subsection~\ref{sec:ballistics-constructor}.)

(Based on page 304 of book "Graphic Gems")

Suppose we have two lines $P$ and $Q$,
represented by the points $(p_1, p_2)$ and $(q_1, q_2)$.
Define the vectors $p$ and $q$ by
\begin{align*}
    p &= p_2 - p_1; \\
    q &= q_2 - q_1.
\end{align*}
Then every point in the line $P$ will be of the form $tp + p_1$
for some real number $t$.
Similarly, every point in the line $Q$ will be of the form $sq + q_1$.
They intersect when
\begin{align*}
    sq + q_1 &= tp + p_1 \\
    sq + q_1 - p_1 &= tp
\end{align*}
Taking the cross product of both sides with $q$ gives
\begin{align*}
    q \times (sq + q_1 - p_1) &= t p \times q \\
    s q \times q + q \times (q_1 - p_1) &= t p \times q
\end{align*}
Since $q \times q = 0$, this simplifies to
\begin{equation*}
    q \times (q_1 - p_1) = t p \times q.
\end{equation*}
Now, take the dot product of both sides with $p \times q$;
this will enable us to isolate $t$:
\begin{align*}
    \langle q \times (q_1 - p_1), p \times q \rangle
        &= t \langle p \times q, p \times q \rangle \\
    \langle q \times (q_1 - p_1), p \times q \rangle &= t ||p \times q||^2 \\
    t &= \frac{\langle q \times(q_1 - p_1), p \times q \rangle}{||p \times q||^2}.
\end{align*}
Since we have $p_1$, $q_1$, $q$ and $p$, we can compute $t$;
so, the intersection is
\begin{equation*}
    tp + p_1,
\end{equation*}
provided the value $|| p \times q ||$ is non-zero.

        \end{scope}

    \caption{Problem of angle of projection}
    \label{fig:angle-of-projection}
\end{figure}

This problem is depicted in the figure \ref{fig:angle-of-projection}.
Given the angle $\gamma$ between the vectors $A$ and $B$
and the angle $\beta$ of their projection in a plane,
determine the angle $\alpha$ that both make with the plane.

We can assume, without loss of generality,
that $||A|| = ||B|| = 1$,
and that $A$ is in the plane $yz$.
The coordinates of the vector $A$ is
\begin{equation*}
    A = (0, \sin \alpha, \cos \alpha).
\end{equation*}
The vector $W$, the projection of $B$ in the plane $xz$,
is a multiple of
\begin{equation*}
    W' = (\sin \beta, 0, \cos \beta).
\end{equation*}
In the plane $yW$, the vector $B$ can be written as
\begin{equation*}
    B = (\cos \alpha, \sin \alpha).
\end{equation*}
As this is in the plane $yW$, in the tridimensional space,
this is
\begin{align*}
    B &= \cos \alpha W' + \sin \alpha y \\
      &= \cos \alpha (\sin \beta, 0, \cos \beta) + \sin \alpha (0, 1, 0) \\
      &= (\cos \alpha \sin \beta, \sin \alpha, \cos \alpha \cos \beta).
\end{align*}

As $||A|| = ||B|| = 1$, the inner product of $A$ and $B$ gives $\cos \gamma$.
Thas is,
\begin{align*}
    \cos \gamma &= \langle A, B \rangle \\
                &= \langle (0, \sin \alpha, \cos \alpha),
            (\cos \alpha \sin \beta, \sin \alpha, \cos \alpha \cos \beta) \rangle \\
                &= \sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha \cos \beta
\end{align*}
Now, replace $\sin^2 \alpha$ by $1 - \cos^2 \alpha$, giving
\begin{align*}
    \cos \gamma &= 1 - \cos^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha \cos \beta \\
    \cos \gamma - 1 &= \cos^2 \alpha( \cos \beta - 1 ) \\
    \frac{\cos \gamma - 1}{\cos \beta - 1} &= \cos^2 \alpha \\
    \cos \alpha &= \sqrt{\frac{\cos \gamma - 1}{\cos \beta - 1}} \\
    \alpha &= \arccos \sqrt{\frac{\cos \gamma - 1}{\cos \beta - 1}}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Finding the axis}
\label{sec:finding-the-axis}

Using the same figure (\ref{fig:angle-of-projection}),
now we seek a way to compute the vector $y$
(the rotation axis)
using only $A$, $B$ and the newly-discovered $\alpha$.

The key observation is that the rotation axis $C$,
the vector $M = (A + B)/2$ and the cross-product $A \times B$
all lie on the same plane
(since the angle between any of them and $A$ is the same angle as
themselves and $B$).
Thus, we need just to rotate $M$ around $M \times (A \times B)$
by some angle to get $C$.
We will compute this angle $\delta$ now.

Let's impose $||C|| = 1$.
We know then that
\begin{align*}
    ||M|| \cos \delta &= \langle C, M \rangle \\
                      &= \langle C, (A + B) / 2 \rangle \\
                      &= \frac{ \langle C, A \rangle + \langle C, B \rangle }{2}
\end{align*}
Now, as $\langle C, A \rangle$ gives $\cos( \pi/2 - \alpha )$
(and similarly for $B$),
we have
\begin{align*}
    ||M|| \cos \delta &= \frac{ \cos(\pi/2 - \alpha) + \cos(\pi/2 - \alpha)}{2} \\
    \cos \delta &= \frac{\cos(\pi/2 - \alpha)}{||M||}.
\end{align*}
Now, substitute $\cos(\pi/2 - \alpha)$ by $\sin \alpha$, giving
\begin{align*}
    \cos \delta &= \frac{\sin \alpha}{||M||}.
\end{align*}
